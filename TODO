1. implement string hashing
2. use ngrams for similarity checking

for this, hash out the strings, form trigrams, then sort the ngrams, then expand both to a vector of size (size1 + size2), then get the frequency vectors and then find cosine similarity of the frequency vectors

Time (almost done) and space complexity (complete)
